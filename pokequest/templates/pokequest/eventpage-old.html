	The following game is the quest to become a pokemon master. The game will be in the form of a story which will keep on scrolling down as you type NEXT or type answer in the textbox given (whenever required) and click SUBMIT. Once you reach next page you are not allowed to go back, So make sure you are making notes of whatever is coming.

	Coming to the game.<br>
	The game focuses on the creatures known as Pokémon, as well as their inhabited world, full of legends, tales, and adventures. Several interpretations of the world explore different themes and elements. Most commonly, Pokémon coexist with humans and can be caught, trained, and used in battles and other activities. Trainers, along with their Pokémon, travel across diverse lands aiming to make their dreams become reality.<br><br>

	<div id="3" style="display:none">

	You are a 16 year old kid from Pallet town and your name is Ash Ketchum. You are going to start your journey to be a pokemon master. Prof. Professor Samuel Oak is a Pokémon Professor who lives and works at his research lab in Pallet Town and he gives you valuable advice and help you achieve your goal of becoming a pokemon master. You have to catch new pokemons, unlock their attacks, fight gym leaders. Once you defeat a gym leader, you are given a badge by gym leader as a proof of your victory.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="4" style="display:none">
	<p>
	<br>
	During your journey, you'll face some hurdles. You need to cross these hurdles and earn points. If you get stuck somewhere, you can skip but surely points would be deducted. The puzzles are deisgned in a way that they are time-consuming, so spend decent amount of time with each puzzle before skipping.<br>
	//Discuss and Add marking scheme here....<br>

	<div id="5" style="display:none">

	The Elite Four are four Pokémon Trainers (Sagar,Vaibhav,Sarthak,Sambit) who are regarded as the toughest in their regional Pokémon League. Those who challenge the Elite Four must have won all eight Badges from that region and face all four and the current Champion consecutively without losing to any of them.

	But wait, any game without a villain is soo boring. So you have to stop Team Rocket from creating nuisance. It is known that Team Rocket have developed a genetically modified pokemon named “SEW TWO” which is very powerful. Your aim is to defeat SEW TWO and stop team rocket from creating such genetically modified pokemons by destroying their laboratories.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="6" style="display:none">
	<p>
	<br>
	But wait, there is a twist to the story. During your journey, you are also accompanied by a Bad luck soul named “HAUNTER”, which keeps on creating problem for you by either entering your pokemon or your pokeballs or anything else. Wait did I mention, what pokeballs are ?
	A Poké Ball is a type of item that is critical to a Trainer's quest, used for catching and storing Pokémon. Up to six Pokémon can be carried with a Trainer in Poké Balls, while any number of other Poké Balls can be held in the Bag for later use. These six Pokémon in the Poké Balls can be attached to the user's belt for carrying them around. Some Pokémon do not like to be carried around in Poké Balls<br>
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="7" style="display:none">
	<p>
	You also have a pokedex with you. The Pokédex is a digital encyclopedia created by Professor Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. It gives information about all Pokémon in the world that are contained in its database.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="8" style="display:none">
	<p>
	And also to take care of “HAUNTER” from creating much hinderance, you have a Tech-freak Pokemon named “TOGEPI”. He used to live with your family in Pallet town and would accompany you in your journey. It is able to siphon the positive energy of others, and then release it to those in need of it. It has a very joyful nature. As a result, it is said that it shares its joy with those who take care of it. Because of its disposition, Togepi are seen as signs of good luck, especially if a Trainer is capable of getting a sleeping Togepi to stand. Because, it was with your family your mom had developed unconditional love for togepi. So, he will accompany you in the journey but you are not allowed to use him in any battles, as you have promised the same to your mom. Being a tech-freak pokemon, it has some crazy gadgets which can be of great help to you. But, togepi loves to ask puzzles and bothers you with it every now and then. It gets irritating sometimes, but you cannot avoid it.

	<p>
	So let the quest begin ...<br>
	The story starts from your 16th birthday ...<br>
	This never ends….. No, don’t be a loser. You gotta do it. Well, it’s simple, you got all the 8 badges and you can beat the Elite Four, then nothing can stop you to become Pokémon master. Here, the battle begins…..<br>
	Sagar: Do you wish to challenge the Elite Four? It won't be easy to defeat us! Let the match begin!<br>
	You: Got it. It’s time. Go Pokemon-Attack!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="10" style="display:none">
	<p>
	Sagar: That’s it! I hate to admit it, but you are a Pokémon master! I’m just kidding. You’re still a kid.<br>
	You: I have become stronger! There's no way I'll lose now! Pokemon-Attack!<br>
	Sagar: Don't think losing will change my ways. To reach the top, you must continue on to face the true might of the Elite Four!<br>
	You: Nothing can stop me to win!<br><br>

	Sagar: Ah! I heard about you, Ash! I lead the Elite Four! You can call me Sagar the dragon trainer! You know that dragons are mythical Pokémon! They’re hard to catch and raise, but their powers are superior! They’re virtually indestructible! Well, are you ready to lose? Your League challenge ends with me, Ash!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="11" style="display:none">
	<p>
	Ash……Ash…..Ash……Ash…..Wake Up! Wake up Ash….Are you dreaming or something? (Prof Oak’s Voice)<br><br>

	You (Open your eyes): WAHHHH! It was a dream! I was about to defeat Sagar.<br>
	Oak: You’re a kid, Ash. You need to learn many things. It isn’t easy to defeat them. Maybe th<br>is isn’t your dream, it’s your aim.<br>
	You (Inspired by the dream): Although it was a dream but I want to become a master!<br>
	Oak: Alright, Pokémon around the world are waiting for you, Ash! Go, get ém all. Now it’s time to face challenges in real world. Make your dream an aim to live up to. Get ready and meet me in the Lab, a surprise for you there!<br>
	(Ash got motivated by Oak’s words! Then he decided to be a master by getting all the 8 badges and then defeat Elite Four by proper training.)
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="12" style="display:none">
	<p>
	In the Prof. Oak’s Lab:<br><br>

	You: Hello, Professor Oak.<br>
	Oak: Hello Ash! Sorry to keep you waiting! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! People call me Pokémon Prof. As you know, this world is inhabited by creatures that we call Pokémon. People and Pokémon live together by supporting each other. Some people play with Pokémon, some battle with them. But we don't know everything about Pokémon yet. There are still many mysteries to solve. That's why I study Pokémon every day.

	<div id="13" style="display:none">
	<p>
	You: What about my surprise!!!<br>
	Oak: Ahhh! See, you need a Pokémon to battle against others. Here we go, Pikachu... Ash, go ahead, it's yours!
	Then suddenly Pikachu makes a Thunder Bolt attack as you tried to keep him in Poke ball. You gotta dodge it.<br>


	You: This Pokémon is really energetic!<br>
	Oak: Your Pikachu dislikes Poké Balls. You should just keep it with you. That should make it happy! You can talk to it and see how it feels about you.<br>
	You: It's quite amazing. Thank you Prof.<br>
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="14" style="display:none">
	<p>
	Are you ready for the journey?<br>
	Oak : Before you go, listen to my words carefully. Raise your young Pokémon by making it fight! You can get detailed data on Pokémon by using Pokedex. You must catch them! Use these to capture wild Pokémon. When a wild Pokémon appears, it’s a fair game. Just like I showed you, throw a Poké Ball at it and try to catch it! This won't always work, though. A healthy Pokémon could escape. You have to be lucky! There's no running away from a Trainer Pokémon battle! If you win, you earn points, and your Pokémon will grow! Battle other Trainers and make your Pokémon strong!<br>
	Take this Pokédex and have a wonderful journey.Don't forget to take Togepi along with you. And never use Togepi for battle, otherwise your mom would be really angry.

	Your journey starts from Ash’s hometown, Pallet Town to Pewter city, through Viridian Forest.<br>
	You: Let’s go Pikachu. We are a team now.<br>
	Pikachu: Pika Pika (Reluctantly)<br>

	You: Aren't you excited buddy. Together we will win all the battles.<br>
	Pikachu: Pika pika...<br>
	Togepi: He's saying “whatever...”.<br>

	Togepi being a Tech-freak has a translator attached, so he can actually communicate with humans. Looks like your Pikachu is least interested in what you think. But why is this happening? Oh wait, you almost forgot about “HAUNTER”. It seems Haunter has entered Pikachu, as reflected from Pikachu's behaviour.

	<div id="16" style="display:none">

	You: What's wrong with him ?<br>
	Togepi:Its “Haunter”, I suppose.<br>
	You: How can I get Haunter out of my Pokémon ?<br>
	Togepi: I know a solution to this problem, but you have to solve this riddle to get the answer.

	Three Words: 16 iii 2 8 9 ii &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 iii 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 i iii 9<br><br>

Charmander dies if its flame goes out.<br>

	Togepi: My God! Ash, you are so dumb. You won’t have more than one charmander, its just an illusion!<br>

	You are Akul, and you find yourself playing a game with your friend Sarthak.<br><br>
	It is played with a deck of only 16 cards, divided into 4 suits:<br>
	  	<i>Red, Blue, Orange and Green</i><br>
	There are four cards in each suit:<br>
	  	<i>Ace, King, Queen and Jack.</i><br><br>

	Ace outranks King, which outranks Queen, which outranks Jack - except for the Green Jack, which outranks every other card.<br><br>

	If two cards have the same face value, then Red outranks Blue, which outranks Orange, which outranks Green, again except for the Green Jack, which outranks everything.<br><br>

	Here's how the game is played: you are dealt one card face up, and your friend is dealt one card face down. Your friend then makes some true statements, and you have to work out who has the higher card, you or your friend. It's that simple!<br><br>

	You have dealt the <strong>Red</strong> <strong>Queen</strong> and your friend makes three statements:<br><br>
	1. My card could lose to a Blue card.<br>
	2. Knowing this, if I am more likely to have an Ace or a King than a Queen or Jack, then I have an Orange card. Otherwise, I don't.<br>
	3. Given all of the information you now know, if I am more likely to have a Jack than an Ace, then I actually have a King. Otherwise, I don't.<br>
	Who has the higher card, you or your friend?<br>
	Valid Answers are “AKUL” or “SARTHAK”<br><br>

	Type your answer!

	The Pokeball safe has a rather unusual control panel.<br>
	In order to open the safe you have to press every single button once only, in the correct sequence, ending on the button marked E.<br><br>

	Each button clearly states which button to press next, for example, 2U means move up 2 buttons and 3R means move right 3 buttons.<br><br>

	Can you determine which button you must start with?<br><br>

	{% load staticfiles %}
	<img src="{% static "assets/images/grid.png" %}" alt="grid"/> <br><br>

	Suppose your answer is the element corresponding to first row and first column i.e. “3R”, then your should submit “3R”.<br><br>

	So type your answer now!

	<h2>WELCOME TO THE FINAL SHOWDOWN!<br><br></h2>
	<p>
	Great Job! Till now you have captured 3 Pokémons and unlocked their attacks. But now you have to face Team rocket and stop them from creating more genetically modified pokémons.<br>
	Their Head Quarters is atop fifty pillars. At each pillar are minions of Team Rocket waiting for you, to stop you from entering into the Head Quarters. You have to not only defeat those minions, and their pokémons, but also defeat “SEW TWO” and destroy their Head Quarters.<br><br>

	All the best!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="96" style="display:none">
	<h3>At the Head Quarters…</h3><br>
	<p>
	You, Misty, Togepi and Haunter approach one of the pillars of the Head Quarters. There you find minions waiting to stop you from entering into their Laboratory...<br><br>

	Team Rocket- JESSIE: Prepare for trouble!<br>
	JAMES: Make it double!<br>
	JESSIE: To protect the world from devastation!<br>
	JAMES: To unite all peoples within our nation!<br>
	JESSIE: To denounce the evils of truth and love!<br>
	JAMES: To extend our reach to the stars above!<br>
	JESSIE: Jessie!<br>
	JAMES: James!<br>
	JESSIE: Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light!<br>
	JAMES: Surrender now, or prepare to fight!<br>
	MEOWTH: Meowth! That's right!

	<div id="97" style="display:none">
	<p>
	Misty: These clowns are here again to create trouble. Why do they keep coming back to lose?<br><br>

	Jessie: Okay Arbok, go and defeat those evil kids!<br>
	Ash: Prepare to lose! Go Squirtle!<br><br>
	
	You release Squirtle to fight Arbok!

	<div id="98" style="display:none"><!-- battle 1.1 -->

	Ash: Squirtle, dodge him and attack!<br><br>

	Type the attack you want Squirtle to perform on Arbok!

	<div id="99" style="display:none"><!-- battle 1.2 -->

	Type some attack!

	</div>

	<div id="102" style="display:none"><!-- battle 2.2 -->

	Type its attack!

	<p>
	Weezing has been defeated.<br><br>

	James: We have been defeated again...<br>
	Misty: Lets go inside Team Rocket’s laboratory.<br><br>

	Inside the laboratory, you see SEW TWO analysing some data on the supercomputer with the Elite Four team imprisoned in the centre and some cords attached to them.<br>
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="104" style="display:none"><!-- battle vs sew two -->
	<p>
	Ash: SEW TWO, we have come to defeat you and free the Elite Four Team.<br>

	SEW TWO: That is impossible, since I am technically not a Pokémon, but a supercomputer. I analyse all the weaknesses of Pokémons and use it to defeat them.<br>
	Togepi: Ash, it would be impossible to defeat him with conventional methods. Think something different.<br>
	Haunter: Oh look! SEW TWO is connected to the main server. If somehow we could distract him and gain access to the server room, we could destroy him.<br><br>
	Ash: (with enthusiasm) No need of that. Me and Pikachu will easily defeat him. Go Pikachu!!! Attack him!<br><br>

	Give an attack for Pikachu to perform!<br>
	</div>

	<div id="105" style="display:none">
	<p>
	SEW TWO uses Shield. Pikachu’s attack has no effect on it.<br><br>

	Togepi: See, I told you, your attacks will have no effect on SEW TWO.<br>

	Haunter: Ash, keep distracting him. I will try to find the server room and gain access to it.<br>

	Ash: Umm...okay.<br>
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="106" style="display:none">
	<p>
	Togepi uses his teleportation powers to enter the server room. Once he is inside the room, he inserts a virus into SEW TWO’s program which erases all of Pikachu’s saved data.<br><br>

	Ash: Oh good!! Now Pikachu, its our chance to defeat SEW TWO. Go!<br><br>
	
	Type Pikachu's attack!

	<div id="107" style="display:none">

	SEW TWO is unable to shield himself from Pikachu’s attack and is destroyed. Meanwhile, Misty and Haunter frees the Elite Four team and they all escape from the headquarters before the whole laboratory is destroyed.
